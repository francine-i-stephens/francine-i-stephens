ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my Github! My name is Francine, and I am data professional with a social science Ph.D. from Stanford University. I have been a data scientist at Carmel Partners Real Estate Investment Firm for one year. The work stored in the repos shows my ability to nimbly ingest, clean, and analyze a variety of datasets - geospatial, satellite imagery, text files, web-based, and structured census/survey -  which is a result of my broad training in quantitative and qualitative data analysis. I have a passion for designing clear and compelling visualizations and maps. 

Previously, I have worked as a Quantitative Researcher at Mozilla, as a Research Scientist at Intuit, and as the first GIS/Spatial Data Analyst for the Texas Democratic Party during the 2020 General Election cycle. Outside of work, I love spending time with my family, exercising, cooking vegan food, reading, and avidly following the NBA, especially the San Antonio Spurs and Denver Nuggets.
